## Project Overview

This project aims to find the best starting positions for the game *Settlers of Catan*. It is currently under development and will include several features to help players configure and analyze their optimal strategies in the game. The tool will allow users to:

- Configure the game board with resource and number positions.
- Set harbor locations.
- Define the importance of each resource.
- Determine how important harbors are in the game.

In future updates, the tool will also allow users to input already built settlements (both their own and from other players), which will be taken into account when calculating optimal positions.

The solution calculation will be based on a mathematical model that helps determine the best positions based on the configuration and user preferences.

## Features

- **Board Configuration**: Allow the user to configure resource tiles and number tiles on the board.
- **Harbor Configuration**: Enable the user to set the positions of harbors on the board.
- **Resource Importance**: Let the user specify how important each resource is for them (e.g., wood, brick, wheat, ore, sheep).
- **Harbor Importance**: Allow users to define the significance of harbors in their strategy.
- **Built Settlements** (Planned Feature): In future versions, users will be able to input built settlements (from themselves and other players) to improve the calculation of optimal starting positions.

## How It Works

The solution will be calculated using a mathematical model that considers the board configuration, resource importance, harbor significance, and any other relevant factors determined by the user. The tool will use this model to suggest the best starting positions for the player based on these inputs.
